Hi, this project is part of my "Codebasics Resume Project Challenge". I am using SQL as our data source and I've solved the ad_hoc_requests using MySQL. Find the data required for the task in the "input_for_participants" file. Results are present in "Results" file for the reference.

Task:  
Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.

Good Luck!
